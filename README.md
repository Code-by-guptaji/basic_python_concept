## 📝 File Handling in Python

Some examples I practiced include:

* Opening files (`open()`)
* Reading files (`read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`)
* Writing and appending (`write()`, `writelines()`)
* Closing files (`close()`)
* Deleting files with `os.remove()`

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-concepts.git
   cd python-concepts
   ```
2. Run Python files:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

## 🎯 Purpose

* To practice and strengthen my understanding of **Python programming**
* To maintain a personal reference of Python examples I learned from **W3Schools**
